{"work":{"slug":"stone-water-sting","date":"2014/01/10","name":"Stone Water Sting","description":"Elements of the ancient Lithuanian mythology have served as an inspiration for the performance and have brought the performance closer to the viewer’s physiology by means of perception theatre techniques. Actors on stage don’t tell a story, imitate characters or create their personalities. The archetypes of birth and death, transformation and nature, space and home, departure and arrival appear with no explanation. They are like perceptively experienced situations or experiences of a consciousness reborn to an exchange of places between blindness and sight.","readMore":"","performers":"Director: Karolina Žernytė \n Dramaturg: Kristupas Sabolius \n Scenopgrapher: Eglė Lekevičiūtė \n Perfomers: Neringa Krunglevičiūtė, Ieva Pakštytė, Raminta Šniaukštaitė, Donatas Stakėnas, Justina Burakaitė, Vaidotas Bačianskas, Karolina Kontenytė, KristinaŠvenčionytė, Artūras Lepiochinas.","images":[{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3123.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3199.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_001.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3103.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3181.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3183.jpg"},{"src":"stonewatersting/vyt_3189.jpg"}],"imagesAuthor":"Vytautas Petrošius","rider":{"duration":"60 minutes","language":"The piece is in English without translation.
